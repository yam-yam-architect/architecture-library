# Method Name: Solution Options

## Context
Multiple technical solutions have been identified for a given solution problem.  

## When To Use
- The solution problem is considered architecturally significant. 
- There are no approved patterns that fit the solution problem.
- Architecture designs have to be approved by a central design authority.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the business objectives, requirements and constraints are understood. 

## Method
- Identify a minimum of two solution options - ensuring, where possible, alignment with the organisation's strategic objectives, i.e. if you're an AWS house, don't pick an Azure tech if AWS has an equivalent. 
- Conduct a t-shirt estimation exercise with the team.
- Identify technical spikes for high-risk assumptions of the solution. The acceptance criteria of the spike should outline what findings must be documented. 
- Complete the options comparison matrix; see the example below.
- Present the options and recommendations to the decision-makers for approval. 
- Capture the decision in the architecture decision log.
